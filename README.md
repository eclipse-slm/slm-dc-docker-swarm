# Ansible Collection - fabos.docker_swarm

The collection provides playbooks for installing and uninstalling of docker swarm on target hosts, scaling up and down of worker nodes (see "setup" role) and deploying and undeploying of container based on docker-compose files (see "use" role). The additional "inventory_helper" role helps to create an inventory based on information available in the context of the FabOS Service Lifecycle Management (SLM).
